In this 75-minute hands-on workshop, you'll experience the complete journey of building an intelligent agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio. Through a practical inventory and order management scenario, you'll learn how to create a sophisticated AI assistant capable of handling real-world business operations.

## Workshop Scenario

You are a solutions engineer tasked with building a retail agent for Zava, a company that needs smarter ways to support customers and manage operations across multiple stores. The agent must not only answer questions about policies like returns, shipping, and warranties, but also connect to Zava’s internal systems so it can add new stores, check product availability, and manage inventory in real time. To accomplish this, you’ll integrate company knowledge with live data through an MCP server, giving the agent the ability to act on operational tasks, not just answer static FAQs.

Finally, you’ll extend the agent to handle warranty claims end-to-end. By layering in AI prompts and a guided approval flow, the agent will be able to take unstructured customer input, extract the right details, and decide whether a claim qualifies for automatic approval or needs escalation. The end result is a single agent that combines knowledge, live system access, and structured decision making to streamline Zava’s customer and store operations.
